**SFS Planet Textures**

**Overview**

Welcome to the **SFS Planet Textures** repository, a collection of **200** meticulously curated textures generated through a Python script. These textures have been handpicked from a pool of **7000**, ensuring that you have access to some of the most unique options. While most of these textures are fully functional, please be aware that a few of them may be corrupted.

**Usage**

You are free to incorporate these textures into your planet packs for various creative purposes. However, it would be greatly appreciated if you could provide proper attribution.

**Background**

These textures were initially developed to serve as a fundamental component of a larger project â€“ a procedural solar system generator. This generator has the capability to construct complete solar systems from scratch. It covers everything from textures, colors, and terrain to planet names, quantities, orbits, stars, and asteroids. Moreover, it supports the creation of multiple solar systems that can be combined to form entire galaxies.

**Beta Phase**

Currently, the project is in its beta testing phase and has been shared with a select group of individuals for testing and feedback. We anticipate that it will be ready for a wider audience in the near future.

Thank you for considering these textures for your creative endeavors. Your support and feedback are invaluable to us as we continue to develop and refine this project.
